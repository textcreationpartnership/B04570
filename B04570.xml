         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A new Revolution, or the High-Flyer turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Whig, in a Letter from a Pariſhoner to his Church-Man.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Relation you ſtand in to me as my Pariſh Miniſter, has neceſſarily drawn upon you the preſent Trouble, for to whom ſhould I apply for Solution of my Religious Scruples, but to him who has the more immediate Care of my Soul? My Manner of Life you very well know has been according to that Sect of our Church call'd <hi>Tories or High-Flyers,</hi> who have diſtinguiſhed themſelves from their Brethren the Whigs or Low-Churchmen, by Pretences to unlimited Loyalty, and an extravagant Zeal for the Safety of the Church, and this I muſt ſay of my ſelf, that bating my having frequented her Aſſemblies oftner, drank leſs, and ſwore ſeldomer for her; no Man has outſtrip'd me in Zeal on all Occaſions. I have heard the Sin of Sciſm diſcrib'd in ſuch odious Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours from your Pulpit, and the Schiſmatick ſo often deliver'd over to Satan, that it has created in me an utter Abhorrence of one, and an Opinion that a Man could not conſiſtently with his being a good Churchman, allow the common Priviledges of Humane Nature to the other. You have taught me, that one might, with leſs Hazard to his Salvation, be guilty of Murder, Adultery, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Blaſphemy, than of Schiſm; and conſequently I ſhould rather have choſen to be found in a Houſe of unlawful Pleaſure, than ſeen in an Aſſembly of our Schiſmatical Diſſenters, whoſe Paces of Worſhip I have with Pleaſure ſeen demoliſh'd and brunt, and (GOD forgive me for it) ſo far hath my Zeal for the Church tranſported me, as to wiſh their Preachers had periſh'd in the Flames: Thus have I all my Life long hug'd my ſelf in the Opinion of my own Or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hodoxy, and a Contempt of thoſe you have taught me to call Schiſmaticks till a little Diſcovery has diſmounted my Confidence; and I am full of doubt whether after all this while that I have accounted my ſelf Something, I am ſtill Nothing, but have miſerably deceived my ſelf: In ſhort, Sir, I am ſtung with that cuting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, <q rend="margQuotes">"Thou art inexcuſeable O Man, whoever thou art, that judges; for wherein thou judgeſt another, thou condemneſt thy ſelf, for thou that judgeſt doſt the ſame Thing: Nor can I ſtand that wounding Interrogatory, and thinkeſt thou this O Man that judgeſt them who do ſuch Things and doſt the ſame, that thou ſhalt eſcape the Judgment of GOD?</q> You will naturally conclude, its the late Schiſm charg'd upon us haſt given me this Uneaſineſs, a Charge, which if it cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd lays us under the moſt dreadful Circumſtances; 'tis a Mine our very Foundation, and if it ſpring with Succeſs, muſt ineviteably bury us all in its Ruines; wonder not then at my Concern in this Matter, wherein I take my Eternal Salvation to be in Diſpute, I ſhall never forget ſuch Paſſag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in your former Diſcourſes as theſe, <q rend="margQuotes">'Schiſm is a Sin directly oppoſite to that Spirit of Love and Union, the peculiar Mark of CHRIST's Diſciples, without which Spirit its impoſſible for any Man to be ſaved.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="margQuotes">'Men may much better diſturb the Peace of the State, than that of the Church. Now if Eternal Damnation be the Reward of the one, what Degree of Damnation is due to the Schiſmatick, who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbs the other? i. e. If I underſtand your Meaning, a Degree of Damnation beyond Eternal: Oh dreadful!</q> — Again, no Returns of Prayers can be expected by ſuch as join with Schiſmaticks, nor no Benefit of Sacraments — <q rend="margQuotes">'Once more, our Communicating with Sciſmaticks, makes us Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, and by Communicating with Excomunicates (which alas, is the Caſe) we not only loſe all our Labour, but we get a Curſe inſtead of a Bleſſing, and turn our very Prayers and Sacraments into Sin.</q> Alas! Alas! What have I been doing all my Lifetime! The very Thoughts fill me with Horrour; ever and anon am I frightned out of my Sleep, with theſe dreadful Words, Shiſm! Schiſm! Reſiſtence! Damnation! Like Peals of Thunder ring in my Ears. Sir, if you have any Bowels of Compaſſion for a poor diſtreſſed Creature, lend me your Aſſiſtance to refute the Charge, which I can no more of my ſelf, than I can remove a Mountain. I have uſed all the Arguments I am Maſter of to no Purpoſe. Sometimes I pleaſe my ſelf that a Majority muſt needs be Orthodox; but when I conſider that we had never reform'd from Popery, and conſequently never been a Church, if it were not a poſſible Caſe for 99 Parts in 100 to be in the Wrong, and for Truth to reſt with the ſmall Remainder, this Argument will not ſerve me; ſometimes I ſhelter my ſelf under the Protection of an Act of Parliament, but I am preſently terretted hence with thoſe memorable Paſſages of yours, <q rend="margQuotes">'Schiſm is an Offence againſt the Laws of GGD, and does not depend upon the changeable Will of our Superiors — Schiſm is a Breach of
<pb facs="tcp:175734:2"/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:175734:2"/>Church Peace and Love,</q> and will always be the Breach of Church Peace and Love, let our Governours ſay or tollerate what they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>My laſt Refuge was to the Validity of the Ordination of theſe Biſhops who join in the Revolution; but I find this Defence is not Canon Proof, for you tell me, Biſhops, tho' duly conſtituted, yet aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating with others who are Intruders, become Schiſmaticks. Nor is this all, for it ſeems they are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comunicates to, and Excommunication (ſay you) certainly includes in it a Depoſition from Epiſcopal Authority, for it metamorphoſes us into Heathens, if theſe Aſſertions of yours, Sir, are true, Lord have Mercy upon us? What a Condition are we all in, who have ſat under the Miniſtry of a Sett of Men who have no more Power to exerciſe any of the Sacerdotal Functions, than my Groom has! I have thought my ſelf a married Man theſe 15 Years, and am the Father of half a Dozon Children; but after all, it ſeems I have only kept a Miſtreſs ſo long, and muſt look on my faucied Wife as the wretched Partner in unlawful Embraces, and thoſe Childred I uſed to behold with Pleaſure, as the dear Pledges of a vittuous Love, I can only regard as the unhappy Iſſue of a polluted Bed; nor have I the Conſolation to think, that Baptiſm has mended their Condition, and made them Members of CHRIST, Children of GOD, and Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven; for alas, they receiv'd it from Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Hands, whoſe Miniſtrations are meer Nullities, and ſo the poor Creatures are in a State of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm ſtill. I have been a conſtant Obſerver of the Feaſts and Faſts of the Church, and duly attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Sacraments; but Woe is me! All this will not ſo much as afford me the poor Negative Comfort, that I have only been doing Nothing to the Purpoſe, for it ſeems I have hereby encreaſed the Score of my Sins. I conjure you, Sir, to uſe your beſt Endeavours to quiet my Mind, under the Apprehenſions of this dreadful Guilt; and if you can, without giving up the Independency of the Church, the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of an uninterrupted Epiſcopal Succeſſion, and the Doctrine of Non Reſiſtance, repal this Charge of Schiſm, then you will be a happy Inſtrument of removing thoſe Scruples which perplex ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a good Churchman, and amongſt the reſt,</p>
